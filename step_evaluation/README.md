# Step Evaluation

The repository contains folders with inference and evaluation methods, including our OWMM-VLM models,PIVOT agent and Robopoint agent. You can execute these scripts to test models in single step evaluation settings. You are required to deploy models and associate it with the appropriate URL in `xxx_inference.py`, and add your API_KEY and BASE_URL to call gpt-4o.
